## Here we go again...

Okay, I screwed up. Although I know I should lock in and build stuff, I failed miserably. About a few months ago, I even posted it on X about my plan before the end of the year. Of course, it has fallen apart.

I wouldn't excuse myself, but I still want to write down what have happened lately so that I can reflect on it, learn my lessons, and hopefully move on.

Basically, I got distracted by the fact that I'm turning 30 and everything is still up in the air, meaning I don't have a stable job and am far from being financially secure. On top of that, I feel like a loser for living with my parents and can't become an independent man. When I had my realisation one night, it seems like a floodgate was opened and I was thrown off track immediately. Then, I realised that I need to do some soul searching, so I just spent my time reading up on how to build wealth and make more money.

Now that I'm writing about it; it sounds hopelessly naive and childlish. But that's not it, I have even considered getting the licence to be an insurance agent and signed up for the license exam, which is tomorrow by the way. I don't know why I did that, but looking back it just seems silly.

Meanwhile, I still received invitation for interview from recruiters on LinkedIn. Even though I was distracted, I still maintain my coding ability by doing [AoC](https://adventofcode.com/2024). However, things are not always rainbows and butterfiles. I actually bombed my most recent technical round, and I felt so terrible that I still don't want to talk about that right now.

Will I be able to bounce back? I don't konw, but I know I need to learn my lessons and take a good hard look at myself. Perhaps all the struggles and mess that I'm going through should be a wake up call to remind me that I should pay less attention to the noise around me and go full [monk mode](https://simplyscheduleappointments.com/2022/04/04/monk-mode/)

But wait a minute, what do I want to achieve by going monk mode and ignoring all the noise? That's a million dollar question. I think a good place to start is to reason from [first principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle#:~:text=%22First%20principles%20thinking%22%20consists%20of,not%20violate%20any%20fundamental%20laws.) and first figure out what I am striving toward first. Yeah, I'm going to start with that.
