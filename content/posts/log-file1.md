## So Far So Good?

Since I get back into learning mode, I have been doing pretty well. I even started doing [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), and I have fun doing it. However, it's not all rainbows and butterflies even though I've now regained my ability to really focus for at least a few hours each day. So, what's the problem?

## The Problem!

The problem is actually twofold. On the one hand, I still have trouble with doing the work. I mean I study a lot but I don't have a lot of things to showcase. Perhaps, I should try [Building in Public](https://buildinpublic.xyz/what-is-build-in-public), but it sounds too cringy. Perhaps, this log file and blog are the output that I want to showcase after all. But I don't think it's enough, as it has no substance.

On the other hand, I feel like going monk mode just lock in for my study is a trap as it means nothing if you have nothing to show for or prove that you're actually doing things instead of just daydreaming. At the end of the day, it's the output and what you do that count, not just what knowledge you have gained. A piece of knowledge or information is useless if it's not actionable.

## What then?

One thing for sure is that I need to increase my output, and I can only achieve that by doing more volumne or reps to get there. It means there'll be a lot of work waiting ahead of me, but I'm willing to go down that path and take up those work if it's the price I have to pay to become the type of engineer I want and do meaningful work.

In the meantime, I'm also considering to go for a degree or get a certification from [AWS](https://pages.awscloud.com/GLOBAL-ln-GC-Traincert-Associate-Certification-Challenge-Registration-2024.html?sc_channel=ha&sc_icampaign=aware_global_200_certification_associatechallenge-q324_midpage_a_tnc&sc_ichannel=ha&sc_icontent=awssm-1839900_event_tnc&sc_iplace=banner&trk=63bf72ae-488f-4078-a096-53b3d346667f~ha_awssm-1839900_event_tnc). The certification is obvious; getting it is for job application purpose so that I can still get some work done and pay my bills. The degree program on the other hand needs more thoughts as it is a serious investment, but I think I'd benefit from what it has to offer (learning from others, a better sturcutred curriculum, working with other like-minded people).
