<p>Okay, I screwed up. Although I know I should lock in and build stuff, I failed miserably. About a few months ago, I even posted it on X about my plan before the end of the year. Of course, it has fallen apart.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t excuse myself, but I still want to write down what have happened lately so that I can reflect on it, learn my lessons, and hopefully move on.</p>
<p>Basically, I got distracted by the fact that I&rsquo;m turning 30 and everything is still up in the air, meaning I don&rsquo;t have a stable job and am far from being financially secure. On top of that, I feel like a loser for living with my parents and can&rsquo;t become an independent man. When I had my realisation one night, it seems like a floodgate was opened and I was thrown off track immediately. Then, I realised that I need to do some soul searching, so I just spent my time reading up on how to build wealth and make more money.</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;m writing about it; it sounds hopelessly naive and childlish. But that&rsquo;s not it, I have even considered getting the licence to be an insurance agent and signed up for the license exam, which is tomorrow by the way. I don&rsquo;t know why I did that, but looking back it just seems silly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I still received invitation for interview from recruiters on LinkedIn. Even though I was distracted, I still maintain my coding ability by doing <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2024">AoC</a>. However, things are not always rainbows and butterfiles. I actually bombed my most recent technical round, and I felt so terrible that I still don&rsquo;t want to talk about that right now.</p>
<p>Will I be able to bounce back? I don&rsquo;t konw, but I know I need to learn my lessons and take a good hard look at myself. Perhaps all the struggles and mess that I&rsquo;m going through should be a wake up call to remind me that I should pay less attention to the noise around me and go full <a href="https://simplyscheduleappointments.com/2022/04/04/monk-mode/">monk mode</a></p>
<p>But wait a minute, what do I want to achieve by going monk mode and ignoring all the noise? That&rsquo;s a million dollar question. I think a good place to start is to reason from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle#:~:text=%22First%20principles%20thinking%22%20consists%20of,not%20violate%20any%20fundamental%20laws.">first principle</a> and first figure out what I am striving toward first. Yeah, I&rsquo;m going to start with that.</p>
