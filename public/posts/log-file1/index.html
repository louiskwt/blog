<p>Since I get back into learning mode, I have been doing pretty well. I even started doing <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>, and I have fun doing it. However, it&rsquo;s not all rainbows and butterflies even though I&rsquo;ve now regained my ability to really focus for at least a few hours each day. So, what&rsquo;s the problem?</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem!</h2>
<p>The problem is actually twofold. On the one hand, I still have trouble with doing the work. I mean I study a lot but I don&rsquo;t have a lot of things to showcase. Perhaps, I should try <a href="https://buildinpublic.xyz/what-is-build-in-public">Building in Public</a>, but it sounds too cringy. Perhaps, this log file and blog are the output that I want to showcase after all. But I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s enough, as it has no substance.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I feel like going monk mode just lock in for my study is a trap as it means nothing if you have nothing to show for or prove that you&rsquo;re actually doing things instead of just daydreaming. At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s the output and what you do that count, not just what knowledge you have gained. A piece of knowledge or information is useless if it&rsquo;s not actionable.</p>
<h2 id="what-then">What then?</h2>
<p>One thing for sure is that I need to increase my output, and I can only achieve that by doing more volumne or reps to get there. It means there&rsquo;ll be a lot of work waiting ahead of me, but I&rsquo;m willing to go down that path and take up those work if it&rsquo;s the price I have to pay to become the type of engineer I want and do meaningful work.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I&rsquo;m also considering to go for a degree or get a certification from <a href="https://pages.awscloud.com/GLOBAL-ln-GC-Traincert-Associate-Certification-Challenge-Registration-2024.html?sc_channel=ha&amp;sc_icampaign=aware_global_200_certification_associatechallenge-q324_midpage_a_tnc&amp;sc_ichannel=ha&amp;sc_icontent=awssm-1839900_event_tnc&amp;sc_iplace=banner&amp;trk=63bf72ae-488f-4078-a096-53b3d346667f~ha_awssm-1839900_event_tnc">AWS</a>. The certification is obvious; getting it is for job application purpose so that I can still get some work done and pay my bills. The degree program on the other hand needs more thoughts as it is a serious investment, but I think I&rsquo;d benefit from what it has to offer (learning from others, a better sturcutred curriculum, working with other like-minded people).</p>
