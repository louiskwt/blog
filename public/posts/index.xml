      <description>Feeling Lost Lately, everything is not going so well. My wife and I had a series of troubles with the retarded landlord after renewing the lease. Meanwhile, I&amp;rsquo;m just working hard and yet everything is still up in the air. On top of that, I made some poor financial decisions (taking the insurance license exams and using more DiDi service than I want). Anyway, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to dwell on the negativites that life throws at us once in a while because I have no control over it.</description>

      <description>Here we go again&amp;hellip; Okay, I screwed up. Although I know I should lock in and build stuff, I failed miserably. About a few months ago, I even posted it on X about my plan before the end of the year. Of course, it has fallen apart.&#xA;I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t excuse myself, but I still want to write down what have happened lately so that I can reflect on it, learn my lessons, and hopefully move on.</description>

      <title>So Far So Good?</title>

      <description>So Far So Good? Since I get back into learning mode, I have been doing pretty well. I even started doing Advent of Code, and I have fun doing it. However, it&amp;rsquo;s not all rainbows and butterflies even though I&amp;rsquo;ve now regained my ability to really focus for at least a few hours each day. So, what&amp;rsquo;s the problem?&#xA;The Problem! The problem is actually twofold. On the one hand, I still have trouble with doing the work.</description>

      <title>A New Start?</title>

      <description>A New Start Time flies, and it&amp;rsquo;s already December 1st. Since this is the beginning of a new month, I want to make some changes to how I approach learning in order to make this month counts. Yes, even though this is the last month of 2024, I just want to size the time I have to actually take my study seriously so that I can become a better version for my next role.</description>
